# frameless_movable_custom_window
to create a fully custom window, we need to make the window somehow movable, here I have an example code of how to reach this goal;
last year, this was a huge challange for me, but now, this is one of my favorite parts of customizing my GUI ;) -
have fun with this, and I would appreciate for any other suggestions.
